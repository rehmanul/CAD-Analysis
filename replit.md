# CAD Analysis Pro

## Overview
A comprehensive CAD analysis application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The application processes DXF, DWG, and PDF files to extract floor plans, optimize space with intelligent îlot placement, and generate efficient corridor systems.

## Project Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons
- **Server**: Development server on port 5000

## Key Features
- Interactive CAD file upload (DXF, DWG, PDF)
- Floor plan extraction and visualization
- Intelligent îlot placement optimization
- Automated corridor generation
- Export capabilities (PDF, DXF, 3D models, JSON)
