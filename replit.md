- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.3.5
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.1
- **UI Components**: Lucide React icons
- **Server**: Development server on port 5000

## Key Features
- Interactive CAD file upload (DXF, DWG, PDF)
- Floor plan extraction and visualization
- Intelligent îlot placement optimization
- Automated corridor generation
- Export capabilities (PDF, DXF, 3D models, JSON)
